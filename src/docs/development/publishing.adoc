We distribute HSC for different usage scenarios to appropriate repositories, i.e., we publish

* The HSC artifacts (Core, Maven plugin, and Gradle plugin) to https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=org.aim42.htmlSanityCheck[Maven Central] (MC) for retrieval by the common Java build tools,
* The HSC Command Line Interface (CLI) distribution to
** https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/releases[GitHub] for download as ZIP- or TAR-File.
** https://sdkman.io/sdks#hsc[SDKMAN] for convenient installation (`sdk install hsc`).
* The HSC Gradle plugin additionally to https://plugins.gradle.org[Gradle Plugin Portal] (GPP).
GPP redirects to MC for any plugin (version) it cannot resolve.
But without separate publication, the search index of GPP does not contain the plugin.
Hence, retrieval of the plugin via the GPP Web UI would be impossible in this case.

== Prerequisites

[[sec:maven-central-account]]
=== Maven Central (Sonatype) account

Make yourself familiar with https://central.sonatype.org/publish-ea/publish-ea-guide/[the publishing process].

[CAUTION]
.Maven Central credentials needed
====
You need respective credentials to upload files to Maven Central for the `org.aim42.htmlSanityCheck` namespace.
Talk to Gernot Starke to get these permissions.
====

You will need to https://central.sonatype.org/register/central-portal/#create-an-account[sign up for Maven Central]
(or, to be more precise, to its provider, Sonatype).
Additionally,
you need
to create https://central.sonatype.org/publish/generate-portal-token/[a portal token]footnote:[This is a different user/password than your login user.].

Check out <<sec:release-environment>> how to inject these credentials in your environment for publication activities.

[[sec:prerequisits-gpp]]
=== Gradle Plugin Portal

It is possible to publish new versions of the Plugin to the https://plugins.gradle.org/[Gradle Plugin Portal].

[[caution:gpp-publisher]]
[CAUTION]
.Unique publisher required
====
Only one person at a time can take responsibility for publishing of plugins (Or new versions) to GPP.
Currently, this is https://plugins.gradle.org/u/GerdAschemann[Gerd Aschemann] (following https://plugins.gradle.org/u/gernotstarke[Gernot Starke]).
Only the current maintainer can change the ownership (by creating a new ownership transformation request at https://github.com/gradle/plugin-portal-requests[]).
====

After creating a user, you need to `login` to GPP:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew -Pprofile=gpp :htmlSanityCheck-gradle-plugin:login
----

This will put the respective key and secret to your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file.
Alternatively, you can set these as environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY=...
export GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET=...
----

[[sec:sdkman-api-credentials]]
=== SDKMAN

We registered HSC already as Vendor with https://sdkman.io[SDKMAN].
Publishing new releases requires https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/wiki/Vendor-onboarding-process#request-api-credentials[API credentials] (and authorization by an existing member of the HSC team,
currently Gerd Aschemann).

We publish new versions to SDKMAN via the respective https://sdkman.io/vendors[API], cf. <<sec:release-environment>>.

[[sec:artifact-signing]]
=== Artifact signing

To successfully upload artifacts and other files (POM etc.), Maven Central requires a valid PGP signature.
A proper GPG (agent) setup is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
Therefore, you need to set up GnuPG in your local `+${HOME}/.gradle/gradle.properties+`,
according to the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#sec:signatory_credentials[Gradle Signatory documentation].

Add the following entries:

[source,properties]
----
signing.keyId=24875D73 <1>
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/Users/me/.gnupg/secring.gpg <2>
signing.password=<SECRET> # <3>
----
<1> You have to provide the id of your key (of course).
<2> Note that you need to specify the literal path to your home directory; it is not possible to refer to system properties like `+${user.home}+` here.
<3> Instead of putting the clear text password into the file, you should  provide it on the command line when calling Gradle
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew -Psigning.password=... <task>
----

[[tip:gpg-agent]]
[TIP]
.Use GPG Agent
====
Alternatively,
you may use the https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg24/gpg-agent.1.html[GPG Agent] of your https://gnupg.org/[GnuPG] installation
to cache the secret in memory,
thereby reducing the risk of accidentally exposing the clear text passphrase in your command line or environment.

You can make use of it by setting the flag `useGpgCmd` to `true`:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew -PuseGpgCmd=true <task>
----

Note that the (native) `gpg` command is used in background and that it cannot request the passphrase when executed.
This may lead to errors like

[source]
----
gpg: Sorry, we are in batchmode - can't get input

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
----

In this case, you have to start the agent and cache the password, e.g., by executing

[source,shell]
----
echo empty | gpg --clearsign -o /dev/null
----
====

[[sec:release-environment]]
=== JReleaser Credentials / Environment Settings

You will have to set the following environment variable to perform misc. https://jreleaser.org[JReleaser] actions.

[source,shell]
----
export JRELEASER_MAVENCENTRAL_STAGE=UPLOAD # <1>
export JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN=... # <2>
export JRELEASER_DEPLOY_MAVEN_MAVENCENTRAL_USERNAME=... # <3>
export JRELEASER_DEPLOY_MAVEN_MAVENCENTRAL_PASSWORD=... # <3>
export JRELEASER_ANNOUNCE_MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN=... <4>
export JRELEASER_SDKMAN_CONSUMER_KEY=... <5>
export JRELEASER_SDKMAN_CONSUMER_TOKEN=... <5>
----
<1> Maven Central publications require two steps.
This variable setting enables <<sec:stage-to-maven-central-and-release-to-github,
upload to the staging area>>, perform <<sec:publish-to-maven-central,the final publication>> interactively.
<2> Get an appropriate GitHub token (needs write access to the repository).
<3> Follow the <<sec:maven-central-account,steps above>> to get the required Maven credentials.
Create a deployment user and password in your Maven Central (Sonatype) https://central.sonatype.com/account[account].
<4> Access token for your Mastodon Account (on https://mastodon.social[]footnote:[Publishing to a different Mastodon server requires more changes.]).
<5> Key and Token for access to the <<sec:sdkman-api-credentials,SDKMAN API>>.


== Publishing actions

=== Adjust version number

Set the version number in xref:gradle.properties[../../../gradle.properties] to the next value.

=== Maintain ChangeLog

Add the respective changes to xref:CHANGELOG.{markdown-suffix}[../../../CHANGELOG.md]

=== Build / Test

Clean, check (test), and perform integration tests:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew clean && ./gradlew check integrationTest
----

=== Publish on Gradle Plugin Portal

Set the respective credentials (cf. <<sec:prerequisits-gpp,GPP Prerequisites>>).
Then publish on GPP:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew -Pprofile=gpp :htmlSanityCheck-gradle-plugin:publishPlugins # <1>
----
<1> An additional `--validate-only` allows to check credentials

Performing this for the first time after a <<caution:gpp-publisher,Change of the maintainer>>
may take some time as the Gradle team will perform some checks.

[TIP]
====
You can delete the published version within 7 days if you fail with one of the following steps.

Once <<sec:publish-to-maven-central,published on Maven Central>>, you should not roll back this step.
====

[[sec:stage-to-maven-central-and-release-to-github]]
=== Sign / Stage to Maven Central and Publish to GitHub

Sign artifacts and load them up to Maven Central and GitHub via https://jreleaser.org[JReleaser].

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew jreleaserRelease -PenableSigning=true -Psigning.password=... # <1> <2>
----
<1> Checkout <<sec:artifact-signing>> for more information.
<2> The `enableSigning` flag is necessary to enforce signing (which is not necessary for local installations,
integration testing, etc.)

The `jreleaserRelease` task will perform several steps (all can be rolled back)

* Implicitly call the task `signAll` which signs
and pushes all required files for publication to a local repository.
* Pick them up from there and load them up to the Maven Central staging area as a new version.
* Release the https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/releases[current state to GitHub]
and tag the current version accordingly.
This includes upload of ZIP- and TAR-application archives.

[TIP]
.Use GPG Agent (command) in practice
====
If you have GPG configured properly, you may use the <<tip:gpg-agent,GPG-Agent>>.

[source,bash,subs="callouts+"]
----
./gradlew jreleaserRelease -PenableSigning=true -PuseGpgCmd=true
----
====

=== Publish to SDKMAN

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew jreleaserPublish
----

This step makes the current version available via SDKMAN.
However, as SDKMAN downloads the respective release from <<sec:stage-to-maven-central-and-release-to-github,GitHub>>
the publication to SDKMAN should follow the GitHub publication.

[[sec:publish-to-maven-central]]
=== Publish on Maven Central (final step)

Eventually publish the <<sec:stage-to-maven-central-and-release-to-github,staged version>> on Maven Central,
i.e., https://central.sonatype.com/publishing[Sonatype Central].

[CAUTION]
====
Once published, you cannot roll back the release on Maven Central as releases are immutable.
Hence, run this step as the very last one if everything else ran smoothly.
====

=== Publish documentation

There is a https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml[GitHub Action Workflow]
to generate and publish the HSC documentation as GitHub page.
Upon pushing Git commits of HSC, it builds the site and checks its integrity contents (by HSC itself),
but does not publish it.

To finally publish https://hsc.aim42.org[the official documentation site],
you have to trigger the workflow of the respective branch or tag with the checkmark _Publish GH Page_ set.

image::trigger-gh-pages-workflow.png[alt="Publish HSC documentation site as GH page by (re-) running GH action workflow"]

=== Announce new release on Social Media

Finally, announce the new release on Social Media, i.e., https://mastodon.social/deck/tags/HTMLSanityCheck[Mastodon (Social)].

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew jreleaserAnnounce
----
